# project-management



Our project is an easy-to-use project management system. The problem with many current project management tools, such as Jira, is that they have a lot of features, but that also means they are over complex and difficult to use, especially when you are wanting to just use it for a small and simple project. Our project management application is useful because it is easy to use and simple to set up.
